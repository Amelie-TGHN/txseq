# A local path to the Ensembl primary assembly in gzipped FASTA format
# This should contain the reference chromosomes, unplaced sequence and unlocalised sequences. It should not contain ALT or patch sequences.
# e.g. for humans, a suitable file can be download from https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
