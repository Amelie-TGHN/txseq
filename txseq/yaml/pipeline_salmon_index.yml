# When using the suggested genome and transcript fasta sequences from gencode

# is not used, Salmon maps reads to the first encountered model in a set of duplicates
# and discards the rest of the gene models in the set.

# size of the kmers that should be used for the quasi index
# From the docs (https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html#preparing-transcriptome-indices-mapping-based-mode):
#
#   "While the mapping algorithms will make used of arbitrarily long matches between the query 
#   and reference, the k size selected here will act as the minimum acceptable length for a 
#   valid match. Thus, a smaller value of k may slightly improve sensitivity. We find that a 
#   k of 31 seems to work well for reads of 75bp or longer, but you might consider a smaller
#   k if you plan to deal with shorter reads. Also, a shorter value of k may improve
#   sensitivity even more when using selective alignment (enabled via the â€“validateMappings 
#   flag). So, if you are seeing a smaller mapping rate than you might expect, consider 
#   building the index with a slightly smaller k."
